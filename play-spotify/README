Some simple (and buggy) Ruby program to control Spotify from the terminal.
It's also able to download Spotify-lists in json form and play those song in that sequence. 

It will probably not be compatible on other any other computer than mine. However, if you want to give it a try. It might be good to know that I'm was running Mac OS X Lion, Spotify v0.6.4, and Ruby 1.8.7 when I the scripts was coded.
