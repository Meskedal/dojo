DEPRECATED
This project has been deprecated. I discovered that what parallelization of sort is already implemented in gnu sort. I knew this but I could not find it for macs version of sort. However, it turns out that Os X does also have it. You just have to run "gsort" which is short for gnu sort. 

UPDATE LOG
- 14.03.2012
* Renamed parasort to psort
* Added random prefix for temp split files
* Can sort files with odd number of lines. Whoohooo!

- 13.03.2012
* realized that I had lock issues. Needed to fix it right away
* Removes temp files as we go
* Uses subprocess.call instead of os.popen when calling sort
* Is able to parallelize sorting into two cpus if the number of lines in the files is even. The program failes if the number of lines are odd.


TODO (Prioritized)
[ ] Add a better input interface for the program
[ ] Split by filesize
[ ] Split by pivot (number of lines)
[x] Make it sort for files with odd number of lines
[x] Make threads done sorting pick up new files to short from queue
