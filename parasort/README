- Introduction
A small, and unfinished,  project that I worked on to help me parallelize sorting
of files on UNIX machines. If I do not update this script it is either because
I have completely forgot about it, or I have not had time to do it.


- 0.0.2-1 alpha
* realized that I had lock issues. Needed to fix it right away

- 0.0.2 alpha
* Removes temp files as we go
* Uses subprocess.call instead of os.popen when calling sort

- 0.0.1 alpha
* Is able to parallelize sorting into two cpus if the number of lines in the files
is even. The program failes if the number of lines are odd.
