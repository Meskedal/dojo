INTRODUCTION
A small, and unfinished,  project that I worked on to help me parallelize sorting
of files on UNIX machines. If I do not update this script it is either because
I have completely forgot about it, or I have not had time to do it.


UPDATE LOG
- 14.03.2012
* Renamed parasort to psort
* Added random prefix for temp split files

- 13.03.2012
* realized that I had lock issues. Needed to fix it right away
* Removes temp files as we go
* Uses subprocess.call instead of os.popen when calling sort
* Is able to parallelize sorting into two cpus if the number of lines in the files is even. The program failes if the number of lines are odd.


TODO
[ ] Make it sort for files with odd number of lines
[ ] Make threads done sorting pick up new files to short from queue
